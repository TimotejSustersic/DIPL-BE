# TODO 

So for testing we will choose 10 cities along slovenija and create pathways between them.
We run our algorithm acros them and then the norma osrm. Now were going to need some king of comparison metrics.
Probably the best is time and distance since its not corelated to the selected vehicle

it  would also be nice to store these testing
frontend could get card of data for normal and our line and we could checkbox each route comparison and have a select all
so we would need to store the test itself and the actual induvidual results of the test

also initial check for already completed lines should be made so we dont have to run the test again
